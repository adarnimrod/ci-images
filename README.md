# ci-images

> Docker images for CI.

A collection of Docker images for quicker CI (negate the need to install common
dependencies during CI leading to quicker runs). The repo is mirrored in
[GitHub](https://github.com/adarnimrod/ci-images) and linked to [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/adarnimrod/ci-images/). Each git branch is a
different image tag (branch `pre-commit` builds tag `pre-commit`, branch
`master` should be `latest` but isn't buildable).
